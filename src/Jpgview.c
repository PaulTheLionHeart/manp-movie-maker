/*
* JPGVIEW.C a module to read *.JPG files.
*
* Written in Microsoft Visual C++ 'C' by Paul de Leeuw.
*
* This file illustrates how to use the IJG code as a subroutine library
* to read or write JPEG image files.  You should look at this code in
* conjunction with the documentation file libjpeg.doc.
*
* This code will not do anything useful as-is, but it may be helpful as a
* skeleton for constructing routines that call the JPEG library.
*
* We present these routines in the same coding style used in the JPEG code
* (ANSI function definitions, etc); but you are of course free to code your
* routines in a different style if you prefer.

/* This half of the example shows how to read data from the JPEG decompressor.
* It's a bit more refined than the above, in that we show:
*   (a) how to modify the JPEG library's standard error-reporting behavior;
*   (b) how to allocate workspace using the library's memory manager.
*
* Just to make this example a little different from the first one, we'll
* assume that we do not intend to put the whole image into an in-memory
* buffer, but to send it line-by-line someplace else.  We need a one-
* scanline-high JSAMPLE array as a work buffer, and we will let the JPEG
* memory manager allocate it for us.  This approach is actually quite useful
* because we don't need to remember to deallocate the buffer separately: it
* will go away automatically when the JPEG object is cleaned up.
*/

/*
* ERROR HANDLING:
*
* The JPEG library's standard error handler (jerror.c) is divided into
* several "methods" which you can override individually.  This lets you
* adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might
* have to update with each future release.
*
* Our example here shows how to override the "error_exit" method so that
* control is returned to the library's caller when a fatal error occurs,
* rather than calling exit() as the standard error_exit method does.
*
* We use C's setjmp/longjmp facility to return control.  This means that the
* routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp() call to
* establish the return point.  We want the replacement error_exit to do a
* longjmp().  But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the
* error_exit routine.  To do this, we make a private extension of the
* standard JPEG error handler object.  (If we were using C++, we'd say we
* were making a subclass of the regular error handler.)
*
* Here's the extended error handler struct:

	* Actually, for output to a stdio stream you needn't worry, because
	* then jpeg_write_scanlines will write all the lines passed (or else exit
	* with a fatal error).  Partial writes can only occur if you use a data
	* destination module that can demand suspension of the compressor.
	* (If you don't know what that's for, you don't need it.)
	*
	* If the compressor requires full-image buffers (for entropy-coding
	* optimization or a multi-scan JPEG file), it will create temporary
	* files for anything that doesn't fit within the maximum-memory setting.
	* (Note that temp files are NOT needed if you use the default parameters.)
	* On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
	* temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.
	*
	* Scanlines MUST be supplied in top-to-bottom order if you want your JPEG
	* files to be compatible with everyone else's.  If you cannot readily read
	* your data in that order, you'll need an intermediate array to hold the
	* image.  See rdtarga.c or rdbmp.c for examples of handling bottom-to-top
	* source data using the JPEG code's internal virtual-array mechanisms.
